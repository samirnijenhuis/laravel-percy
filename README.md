# Use Percy.io in your Laravel testsuite
This is an unofficial package to bring Percy to your Laravel testsuite, we are in no way related to Percy.io

## What It Does

This package allows you to easily use Percy in your existing Laravel testsuite

## Installation

### First make sure you have the Percy CLI installed

```bash
npm install --save-dev @percy/cli
```

or

```bash
yarn add --dev @percy/cli
```

### Install this package

```bash
composer require --dev letspaak/laravel-percy
```

### Add the `PERCY_TOKEN` to your .env file

```bash
PERCY_TOKEN=aaabbbcccdddeeefff
```

## Usage

By default we use Laravel's Dusk package to capture our webpages that we send to Percy.

```php
// Visit the homepage and send the snapshot to Percy
$browser->visit('/')->snapshot('Homepage')
```

After your tests are created, run them as follows:

```bash
npx percy exec -- php artisan dusk
```
